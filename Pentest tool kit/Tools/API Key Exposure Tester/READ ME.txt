# üîê API Key Exposure Tester (GUI Tool)

This is a Python GUI tool for scanning files (JSON or TXT) for **exposed API keys** using regular expressions. It helps detect accidental credential exposure in API responses, logs, or source code.

## üí° How It Works (My Method)

I built a tool using Python‚Äôs `Tkinter` for the GUI. The logic:
1. Let the user upload a file (API response, logs, etc.)
2. Scan the file for known API key patterns using `re` (regex)
3. Show the result in the GUI
4. Save the findings to a `api_key_logs/` folder for future reference

I also generated a dummy file containing a fake `Stripe` key (`sk_test_...`) to show the tool in action.

##  Dummy File for Testing

The file `dummy_api_service/api_response_*.json` contains a test key:
```json
{
    "user": "test_user",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "api_key": "sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc"
}
