#  Rate Limiting Bypass Tester (GUI Tool)

This tool simulates methods used to bypass **rate-limiting** mechanisms in APIs or login endpoints. It is strictly for ethical use in testing your systems.

##  How I Built It

I created a simple GUI in Python using `Tkinter` that:
1. Loads a dummy `.txt` file containing a sample "rate limit" error response (429)
2. Simulates 3 common bypass tricks:
   - Changing User-Agent header
   - Spoofing IP via X-Forwarded-For
   - Sending bursts with short delays
3. Randomizes results (true simulation)
4. Logs every result into a timestamped report file

##  How to Use

1. Run this script:
```bash
python rate_limit_tester.py
