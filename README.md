# Cyber-Security-Project
 PROJECTS
1. Loan App Penetration Testing Toolkit
Python, OWASP Top 10, Tkinter, Ethical Hacking
Built a custom GUI-based toolkit that simulates and detects common vulnerabilities in fintech apps (SQL injection, XSS, API key exposure, rate-limiting bypass). Designed with standalone tools and dummy environments to safely test and log vulnerabilities.

2. Credit Fraud Detection System
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Streamlit
Developed a machine learning model to detect suspicious credit/loan applications using real-world fraud datasets. Deployed a live dashboard with Streamlit and secured a basic API layer using FastAPI. Helped demonstrate how fraud detection can save fintechs like Lendsqr from losses.

3. Secure API Gateway for Loan Apps
FastAPI, JWT, SQLite, Redis
Designed and built a backend API for a sample loan platform. Features include JWT-based authentication, IP blocking after multiple failed logins, role-based access, and Redis-powered rate-limiting. Focused on secure backend design and mitigation of abuse.

4. Data Leakage Detection Script (DLDS)
Python, Regex, Security Monitoring
Wrote a script to scan directories and cloud folders (simulated) for sensitive data like API keys, passwords, and PII. Uses regex patterns to match and report possible leaks. Can be extended to send alerts via webhooks or email.

5. Mini SIEM System
Python, Asyncio, Log Analysis, Security Monitoring
Developed a local log monitoring and analysis system to detect brute-force login attempts and unusual access patterns. Uses real-time processing and can trigger alerts. Designed to integrate with existing Flask or Django apps.

6. Encrypted Chat Application (Mini WhatsApp)
Python, PyNaCl, Streamlit
Created a secure messaging prototype with end-to-end encryption using NaCl library. Includes secure login, user auditing (admin-only), and simple GUI interface. Demonstrates understanding of encryption and privacy principles.

7. Loan Fraud Simulator & Response System
Python, Automation, Simulation
Simulated common fraud patterns like fake borrower identity and account takeover. Built a response script that automatically flags accounts, sends alerts, and logs incidents. Emphasized fraud automation and incident response.

8. FraudShield
Python, Behavioral Analysis, Web Security
An anti-fraud tool that uses heuristic patterns and user activity scoring to flag suspicious login or transaction behavior. Capable of integrating with simple web forms or backend APIs for real-time fraud monitoring.

9. AltSec (Alternative Security Toolkit)
Bash, Python, Kali Linux
Designed for offline security analysis and reconnaissance on Linux systems. Combines CLI tools for quick vulnerability checks, port scans, and file integrity validation. Aimed at field security engineers and ethical hackers.
